# IncrementFolders
A very basic batch file that increments a filename to help manage duplicate files and folders!

I needed an easy way to manage LOTS of duplicate files and documents so I wrote a VERY basic batch file to add a number in parentheses to the end of the filename.
Just add to the directory where you have a lot of files and/or documents that you want to rename before merging into another directory. Double-click and (1) will be added to the end of the filename.

# Caveats
Currently (1) will be added to the end of the document or file. So you can get filenames like:
Version 1 (1) (1)
Future updates will include incrementing the number at the end of the filename. :D
